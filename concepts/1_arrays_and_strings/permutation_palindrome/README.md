Check if 2 strings are a permutation of a palindrome.

Palindrome = word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards.
Examples: madam or kayak

Thought Process:
1. The character count must be even except for 1 number max (depends on length)
2. Do spaces count? - no only chars
3. Consider only having 1 item
4. Does uppercase count? - no, just compare the char
